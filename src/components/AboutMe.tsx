          Iâ€™ve spent a year studying Front-End Web Development. Learning the
          basics and applying them to understand core concepts, I hope to be
          able to offer my services for individuals and businesses alike;
          Moreover, perpetually, all aspects of my life involve learning and
          growing.
        </p>

          For almost a decade, I have been living in Cairo teaching in the
          British Primary School system. I have worked at 4 schools during my
          time and gained the skills of an effective teacher. Problem solving,
          collaboration, and communication are some of the critical skills that
          I have cultivated during my near decade as an Educator. These skills
          contribute to my work as a web developer.
